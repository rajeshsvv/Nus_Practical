<!-- You can use JavaScript to create a complex animation having, 
but not limited to, the following elements −

Fireworks
Fade Effect
Roll-in or Roll-out
Page-in or Page-out
Object movements

You might be interested in existing JavaScript based animation library: Script.Aculo.us.



JavaScript can be used to move a number of DOM elements (<img />, <div> or any other HTML element) 
around the page according to some sort of pattern determined by a logical equation or function.

JavaScript provides the following two functions to be frequently used in animation programs.

setTimeout( function, duration) − This function calls function after duration milliseconds from now.

setInterval(function, duration) − This function calls function after every duration milliseconds.

clearTimeout(setTimeout_variable) − This function calls clears any timer set by the setTimeout() functions.

JavaScript can also set a number of attributes of a DOM object including its position on the screen. 
You can set top and left attribute of an object to position it anywhere on the screen. 


Manual Animation
So let's implement one simple animation using DOM object properties and JavaScript functions as follows. The following list contains different DOM methods.

We are using the JavaScript function getElementById() to get a DOM object 
and then assigning it to a global variable imgObj.

We have defined an initialization function init() to initialize imgObj 
where we have set its position and left attributes.

We are calling initialization function at the time of window load.

Finally, we are calling moveRight() function to increase the left distance by 10 pixels. 
You could also set it to a negative value to move it to the left side. -->

    var imgObj = null;
            
            function init() {
               imgObj = document.getElementById('myImage');
               imgObj.style.position= 'relative';

<p>Click button below to move the image to right</p>
<input type = "button" value = "Click Me" onclick = "moveRight();" /> -->


<!-- Automated Animation
In the above example, we saw how an image moves to right with every click. 
We can automate this process by using the JavaScript function setTimeout() as follows −

Here we have added more methods. So let's see what is new here −

The moveRight() function is calling setTimeout() function to set the position of imgObj.

We have added a new function stop() to clear the timer set by setTimeout() function 
and to set the object at its initial position. -->

<!-- <script type = "text/javascript">
    
       var imgObj = null;
       var animate ;
       
       function init() {
          imgObj = document.getElementById('myImage');
          imgObj.style.position= 'relative'; 
          imgObj.style.left = '0px'; 
       }
       function moveRight() {
          imgObj.style.left = parseInt(imgObj.style.left) + 10 + 'px';
          animate = setTimeout(moveRight,20);    // call moveRight in 20msec
       }
       function stop() {
          clearTimeout(animate);
          imgObj.style.left = 'px';

 </script>

<img id = "myImage" src = "/3_ADVANCED\images\html.gif" />
<p>Click the buttons below to handle animation</p>
<input type = "button" value = "Start" onclick = "moveRight();" />
<input type = "button" value = "Stop" onclick = "stop();" />    -->
