<!-- JavaScript is an Object Oriented Programming (OOP) language. 
A programming language can be called object-oriented 
if it provides four basic capabilities to developers.

Encapsulation − the capability to store related information, whether data or methods, 
together in an object.

Aggregation − the capability to store one object inside another object.

Inheritance − the capability of a class to rely upon another class (or number of classes) 
for some of its properties and methods.

Polymorphism − the capability to write one function or method that works in a variety of different ways.

Objects are composed of attributes. If an attribute contains a function, 
it is considered to be a method of the object, otherwise the attribute is considered a property 

User-Defined Objects
All user-defined objects and built-in objects are descendants of an object called Object.

The new Operator
The new operator is used to create an instance of an object. 
To create an object, the new operator is followed by the constructor method.

In the following example, the constructor methods are Object(), Array(), and Date(). 
These constructors are built-in JavaScript functions.

The Object() Constructor
A constructor is a function that creates and initializes an object. 
JavaScript provides a special constructor function called Object() to build the object. 
The return value of the Object() constructor is assigned to a variable.

The variable contains a reference to the new object. 
The properties assigned to the object are not variables and are not defined with the var keyword.

    // create Different Different Objects

    // document.write("car name was:"+newcar.company+"<br/>");
    // document.write("car tyre was:"+newcar.tyre);
    
        

    // Defining Methods for an Object:
    // this keyword is used to refer to the object that has been passed to a function.
    // function amountprice(amount)
    //     {
    //         this.price=amount;
    //     }
    // function book(title,author)
    //     {
    //         this.title=title;
    //         this.author=author;
    //         this.amountprice=amountprice;   //Assign the method as property
    //     }

    // var myBook=new book("A Love Story","Chetan Bhagath");
    // myBook.amountprice(500);
    // document.write("book title was : "+myBook.title+"<br/>")
    // document.write("book author was : "+myBook.author+"<br/>")
    // document.write("book price was : "+myBook.price+"<br/>")


    // With Keyword
    // The ‘with’ keyword is used as a kind of shorthand for referencing an object's properties or methods.
     // Define a function which will work as a method
    function addPrice(amount) {
            with(this){
               price = amount;
            }
         }
    function book(title, author) {
            this.title = title;
            this.author = author;
            this.price = 0;
            this.addPrice = addPrice;  // Assign that method as property.
         }
    var myBook = new book("Perl", "Mohtashim");
    myBook.addPrice(100);
    
    document.write("Book title is : " + myBook.title + "<br>");
    document.write("Book author is : " + myBook.author + "<br>");
    document.write("Book price is : " + myBook.price + "<br>");
