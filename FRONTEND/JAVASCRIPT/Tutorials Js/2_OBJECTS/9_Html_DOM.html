<!-- Every web page resides inside a browser window which can be considered as an object.
A Document object represents the HTML document that is displayed in that window. 
The Document object has various properties that refer to other objects 
which allow access to and modification of document content.
The way a document content is accessed and modified is called the Document Object Model, or DOM. 
The Objects are organized in a hierarchy. 
This hierarchical structure applies to the organization of objects in a Web document.

Window object − Top of the hierarchy. It is the outmost element of the object hierarchy.

Document object − Each HTML document that gets loaded into a window becomes a document object. 
The document contains the contents of the page.

Form object − Everything enclosed in the <form>...</form> tags sets the form object.

Form control elements − The form object contains all the elements defined for that object 
such as text fields, buttons, radio buttons, and checkboxes. 


DOM compatibility
If you want to write a script with the flexibility to use either W3C DOM or IE 4 DOM depending 
on their availability, 
then you can use a capability-testing approach that first checks for the existence of a method
 or property to determine whether the browser has the capability you desire. For example −




-->




<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="ie=edge">
    <title>Document</title>
</head>
<body>
    <script type="text/javascript">
    alert("checking")
    var browser=document.write("Google chrome \n")
    document.write(browser)    
    if (document.getElementById) {
    // If the W3C method exists, use it
    // alert("result")
    } else if (document.all) {
    // If the all[] array exists, use it
    alert("result")
    } else {
    // Otherwise use the legacy DOM
    alert("result")
    }
    </script>
    
</body>
</html>
