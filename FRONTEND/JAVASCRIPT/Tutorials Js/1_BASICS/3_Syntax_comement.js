/*

JavaScript can be implemented using JavaScript statements that are placed within the
 <script>... </script> HTML tags in a web page.

You can place the <script> tags, containing your JavaScript,anywhere within your web page, 
but it is normally recommended that you should keep it within the <head> tags.

The <script> tag alerts the browser program to start interpreting all the text between these tags
 as a script.

 Language − This attribute specifies what scripting language you are using. 
 Typically, its value will be javascript. 
 Although recent versions of HTML (and XHTML, its successor) have phased out the use of this attribute.

Type − This attribute is what is now recommended to indicate the scripting language in use
and its value should be set to "text/javascript".



Whitespace and Line Breaks:
JavaScript ignores spaces, tabs, and newlines that appear in JavaScript programs. 
You can use spaces, tabs, and newlines freely in your program and 
you are free to format and indent your programs in a neat and consistent way 
that makes the code easy to read and understand.

Semicolons are Optional:
var1 = 10
var2 = 20
                or
var1 = 10; var2 = 20;


Note − It is a good programming practice to use semicolons.

Case Sensitivity:
JavaScript is a case-sensitive language. 
This means that the language keywords, variables, function names, and any other identifiers 
must always be typed with a consistent capitalization of letters.

So the identifiers Time and TIME will convey different meanings in JavaScript.

NOTE − Care should be taken while writing variable and function names in JavaScript
