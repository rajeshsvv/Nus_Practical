<!-- JavaScript provides full control to handle loops and switch statements. 
There may be a situation when you need to come out of a loop without reaching its bottom. 
There may also be a situation when you want to skip a part of your code block and 
start the next iteration of the loop.

To handle all such situations, JavaScript provides break and continue statements. 
These statements are used to immediately come out of any loop or 
to start the next iteration of any loop respectively. 

The break statement, which was briefly introduced with the switch statement, 
is used to exit a loop early, breaking out of the enclosing curly braces.

The continue Statement
The continue statement tells the interpreter to immediately start the next iteration of the loop
 and skip the remaining code block. 
 When a continue statement is encountered, the program flow moves to the loop check expression 
 immediately and if the condition remains true, then it starts the next iteration, 
 otherwise the control comes out of the loop.

<!-- Using Labels to Control the Flow -->

<!-- Starting from JavaScript 1.2, a label can be used with break and continue to control the flow
more precisely. 
A label is simply an identifier followed by a colon (:) that is applied to a statement or a block of code.

Line breaks are not allowed between the ‘continue’ or ‘break’ statement and its label name. 
Also, there should not be any other statement in between a label name and associated loop. -->

    <!-- <script type="text/javascript">
        document.write("Entering the loop!<br /> ");
            outerloop:        // This is the label name         
            for (var i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
                document.write("Outerloop: " + i + "<br />");
                innerloop:
                for (var j = 0; j < 5; j++) {
                    if (j > 3 ) break ;           // Quit the innermost loop
                    if (i == 2) break innerloop;  // Do the same thing
                    if (i == 4) break outerloop;  // Quit the outer loop
                    document.write("Innerloop: " + j + " <br />");
                }
