<!-- JavaScript also defines two trivial(small thing) data types, null and undefined, 
each of which defines only a single value
In addition to these primitive data types, JavaScript supports a composite data type known as object.

JavaScript does not make a distinction between integer values and floating-point values. 
All numbers in JavaScript are represented as floating-point values. 
JavaScript represents numbers using the 64-bit floating-point format defined by the IEEE 754 standard. 

JavaScript Variables:
var money;
        var name;
        var name,money; declare like this

Storing a value in a variable is called variable initialization. 
You can do variable initialization at the time of variable creation 
or at a later point in time when you need that variable

Note − Use the var keyword only for declaration or initialization, 
once for the life of any variable name in a document. 
You should not re-declare same variable twice.

JavaScript is untyped language. This means that a JavaScript variable can hold a value of any data type. 
Unlike many other languages, you don't have to tell JavaScript during variable declaration 
what type of value the variable will hold. 
The value type of a variable can change during the execution of a program 
and JavaScript takes care of it automatically.

JavaScript Variable Scope:
The scope of a variable is the region of your program in which it is defined. 
JavaScript variables have only two scopes.

Global Variables − A global variable has global scope which means it can be defined anywhere in your 
JavaScript code.

Local Variables − A local variable will be visible only within a function where it is defined. 
Function parameters are always local to that function.


Within the body of a function, a local variable takes precedence over a global variable
 with the same name. 
 If you declare a local variable or function parameter with the same name as a global variable, 
 you effectively hide the global variable

 JavaScript variable names are case-sensitive. For example, Name and name are two different variables.
 reserved words cannot be used as JavaScript variables, functions, methods, loop labels, or any object names.
