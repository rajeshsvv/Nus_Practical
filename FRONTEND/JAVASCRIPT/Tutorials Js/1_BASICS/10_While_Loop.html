<!-- While writing a program, you may encounter a situation 
where you need to perform an action over and over again. 
In such situations, you would need to write loop statements to reduce the number of lines.

The purpose of a while loop is:
to execute a statement or code block repeatedly as long as an expression is true. 
Once the expression becomes false, the loop terminates. 

The do...while Loop:
The do...while loop is similar to the while loop except that the condition check happens 
at the end of the loop. 
This means that the loop will always be executed at least once, even if the condition is false.

do {
   Statement(s) to be executed;
} while (expression);
