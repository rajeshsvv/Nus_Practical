<!-- What are Cookies ?
Web Browsers and Servers use HTTP protocol to communicate and HTTP is a stateless protocol. 
But for a commercial website, it is required to maintain session information among different pages. 
For example, one user registration ends after completing many pages. 
But how to maintain users' session information across all the web pages.

In many situations, using cookies is the most efficient method of remembering and tracking preferences, 
purchases, commissions, and other information required for better visitor experience or site statistics.

How It Works ?
Your server sends some data to the visitor's browser in the form of a cookie. 
The browser may accept the cookie. 
If it does, it is stored as a plain text record on the visitor's hard drive. 
Now, when the visitor arrives at another page on your site, 
the browser sends the same cookie to the server for retrieval. 
Once retrieved, your server knows/remembers what was stored earlier.

Cookies are a plain text data record of 5 variable-length fields −

Expires − The date the cookie will expire. 
If this is blank, the cookie will expire when the visitor quits the browser.

Domain − The domain name of your site.

Path − The path to the directory or web page that set the cookie. 
This may be blank if you want to retrieve the cookie from any directory or page.

Secure − If this field contains the word "secure", 
then the cookie may only be retrieved with a secure server. 
If this field is blank, no such restriction exists.

Name=Value − Cookies are set and retrieved in the form of key-value pairs

Cookies were originally designed for CGI programming. 
The data contained in a cookie is automatically transmitted between the web browser and the web server, 
so CGI scripts on the server can read and write cookie values that are stored on the client.

JavaScript can also manipulate cookies using the cookie property of the Document object. 
JavaScript can read, create, modify, and delete the cookies that apply to the current web page. 


Storing Cookies
The simplest way to create a cookie is to assign a string value to the document.cookie object, 
which looks like this.

document.cookie = "key1 = value1;key2 = value2;expires = date";

Here the expires attribute is optional. 
If you provide this attribute with a valid date or time, then 
the cookie will expire on a given date or time and thereafter,the cookies' value will not be accessible.

Note − Cookie values may not include semicolons, commas, or whitespace. 
For this reason, you may want to use the JavaScript escape() function to encode the value before storing
 it in the cookie. 
 If you do this, you will also have to use the corresponding unescape() function 
 when you read the cookie value.

</form>


<!-- Deleting a Cookie -->
<!-- Sometimes you will want to delete a cookie so that subsequent attempts to read the cookie return nothing.
To do this, you just need to set the expiry date to a time in the past. -->

<!-- <script type="text/javascript">
    function WriteCookie() {
               var now = new Date();
               now.setMonth( now.getMonth() - 1 );
               cookievalue = escape(document.myform.customer.value) + ";"
               
               document.cookie = "name=" + cookievalue;
               document.cookie = "expires=" + now.toUTCString() + ";"
               document.write("Setting Cookies : " + "name=" + cookievalue );
    }
</script>
