<!-- What is an Event ?
JavaScript's interaction with HTML is handled through events that occur 
when the user or the browser manipulates a page.

When the page loads, it is called an event. 
When the user clicks a button, that click too is an event. 
Other examples include events like:
pressing any key, 
closing a window, 
resizing a window, etc.

Developers can use these events to execute JavaScript coded responses, 
which cause buttons to close windows, messages to be displayed to users, 
data to be validated, and virtually any other type of response imaginable.

Events are a part of the Document Object Model (DOM) Level 3 
and every HTML element contains a set of events which can trigger JavaScript Code. -->

                <!-- onclick Event Type -->

<script type="text/javascript">
    function sayHello()
    {
        alert("Hello World")
    }
</script>
<!-- <input type="button" onclick="sayHello()" value="Say Hello"> -->


                <!-- onsubmit Event Type

onsubmit is an event that occurs when you try to submit a form. 
You can put your form validation against this event type.

Example
The following example shows how to use onsubmit. 
Here we are calling a validate() function before submitting a form data to the webserver. 
If validate() function returns true, the form will be submitted, otherwise it will not submit the data. -->

<script type="text/javascript">
    function validate()
    {
        return true
    }
</script>
    <form method = "POST" action = "t.cgi" onsubmit = "return validate()">
        <!-- <input type = "submit" value = "Submit" /> -->
    </form>



                <!-- onmouseover and onmouseout
These two event types will help you create nice effects with images or even with text as well. 
The onmouseover event triggers when you bring your mouse over any element and the onmouseout 
triggers when you move your mouse out from that element.  -->

<script type="text/javascript">
    function over()
    {
        document.write("Mouse Over");
    }
    function out()
    {
        document.write("Mouse out");
    }
</script>
    <p>Bring your mouse inside the division to see the result:</p>  
    <div onmouseover="over()" onmouseout="out()">
    <h2>This is inside the Event</h2>
    </div>
</body>
