<!-- By default, your webpage background is white in color
You may not like it, but no worries. 
HTML provides you following two good ways to decorate your webpage background. -->

<!-- 1-HTML Background with Colors
2-HTML Background with Images -->

<!-- Html Background with Colors -->

<!-- The bgcolor attribute is used to control the background of an HTML element, 
specifically page body and table backgrounds.

The bgcolor attribute deprecated in HTML5. Do not use this attribute -->


<!-- Html Background with Images -->

<!-- The background attribute can also be used to control the background of an HTML element, 
specifically page body and table backgrounds. 
You can specify an image to set background of your HTML page or table.

Note âˆ’ The background attribute is deprecated and 
it is recommended to use Style Sheet for background setting. -->

<!-- Patterned & Transparent Backgrounds -->
<!-- You might have seen many pattern or transparent backgrounds on various websites. 
This simply can be achieved by using patterned image or transparent image in the background.

It is suggested that while creating patterns or transparent GIF or PNG images, 
use the smallest dimensions possible even as small as 1x1 to avoid slow loading. -->
