<!-- HTML Forms are required, when you want to collect some data from the site visitor. 
For example, during user registration you would like to collect information such as name, 
email address, credit card, etc. 
A form will take input from the site visitor and 
then will post it to a back-end application such as CGI, ASP Script or PHP script etc.

There are various form elements available like
text fields, textarea fields, drop-down menus, radio buttons, checkboxes, etc.


1	action

Backend script ready to process your passed data.

2	method

Method to be used to upload data. The most frequently used are GET and POST methods.

3	target

Specify the target window or frame where the result of the script will be displayed. 
It takes values like _blank, _self, _parent etc.

4	enctype

You can use the enctype attribute to specify how the browser encodes the data 
before it sends it to the server. Possible values are −

application/x-www-form-urlencoded − This is the standard method most forms use in simple scenarios.

mutlipart/form-data − This is used when you want to upload binary data in the form of files like
 image, word file etc.
