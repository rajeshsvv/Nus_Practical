<!-- All the HTML elements can be categorized into two categories
(a) Block Level Elements (b)Inline Elements -->


<!-- Block Elements -->
<!-- Block elements appear on the screen as if they have a line break before and after them. 
For example, the 
<p>, <h1>, <h2>, <h3>, <h4>, <h5>, <h6>, <ul>, <ol>, <dl>, <pre>, <hr />, <blockquote>, and <address> 
elements are all block level elements.
They all start on their own new line, and anything that follows them appears on its own new line. -->

<!-- Inline Elements -->
<!-- Inline elements, on the other hand, can appear within sentences 
and do not have to appear on a new line of their own. 
<b>, <i>, <u>, <em>, <strong>, <sup>, <sub>, <big>, <small>, <li>, <ins>, <del>, 
<code>, <cite>, <dfn>, <kbd>, and <var> elements are all inline elements. -->

<!-- Grouping HTML Elements -->

<!-- There are two important tags 
which we use very frequently to group various other HTML tags 
(i) <div> tag and (ii) <span> tag -->


<!-- The <div> tag
This is the very important block level tag which plays a big role in grouping various other HTML tags
 and applying CSS on group of elements. 
 Even now <div> tag can be used to create webpage layout 
where we define different parts (Left, Right, Top etc.) of the page using <div> tag. 
This tag does not provide any visual change on the block 
but this has more meaning when it is used with CSS. -->

<!-- The <span> tag -->
<!-- The HTML <span> is an inline element and it can be used to group inline-elements in an HTML document. 
This tag also does not provide any visual change on the block 
but has more meaning when it is used with CSS.
        
The difference between the <span> tag and the <div> tag is that 
the <span> tag is used with inline elements whereas 
the <div> tag is used with block-level elements. -->
