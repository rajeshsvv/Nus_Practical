<!-- Sometimes you need to add music or video into your web page. 
The easiest way to add video or sound to your web site is to include the special HTML tag called <embed>.

You can also include a <noembed> tag for the browsers which don't recognize the <embed> tag. 


The <embed> Tag Attributes
The align and autostart attributes deprecated in HTML5. Do not use these attributes.

align   autostart   loop    playcount   hidden
width   height      name    src         volume 


Supported Video Types:
    .swf files − are the file types created by Macromedia's Flash program.

    .wmv files − are Microsoft's Window's Media Video file types.

    .mov files − are Apple's Quick Time Movie format.

    .mpeg files − are movie files created by the Moving Pictures Expert 

Background Audio:
You can use HTML <bgsound> tag to play a soundtrack in the background of your webpage. 
This tag is supported by Internet Explorer only and most of the other browsers ignore this tag. 
It downloads and plays an audio file when the host document is first downloaded by the user 
and displayed. The background sound file also will replay whenever the user refreshes the browser.

Note − The bgsound tag is deprecated and it is supposed to be removed in a future version of HTML. 
So they should not be used rather, it's suggested to use HTML5 tag audio for adding sound. 
But still for learning purpose, this chapter will explain bgsound tag in detail.

 <!-- HTML Object tag -->

 <!-- HTML 4 introduces the <object> element, 
which offers an all-purpose solution to generic object inclusion. 
The <object> element allows HTML authors to specify everything required by an object 
for its presentation by a user agent. -->
