Basis of comparison	            Python 3	                                Python 2

Release Date                    2008      	                                2000
Function print                  print("hello")	                            print "hello"
Division of Integers	        Whenever two integers are divided, 	        When two integers are divided, you always provide integer value
                                 you get a float value
                                Unicode

Unicode                         In Python 3, default storing of,	        To store Unicode string value, you require to define them with "u".
                                strings is Unicode


Syntax                          The syntax is simpler and,                  The syntax of Python 2 was comparatively difficult to understand.
                                easily understandable


Rules of ordering Comparisons	In this version, Rules of ordering, 	    Rules of ordering comparison are very complex.
                                comparisons have been simplified

Iteration                       The new Range() function introduced,   	    In Python 2, the xrange() is used for iterations.
                                to perform iterations.

Exceptions                      It should be enclosed in parenthesis.	    It should be enclosed in notations.

Leak of variables               The value of variables never changes.	    The value of the global variable will change while using it inside for-loop.

Backward compatibility	        Not difficult to port python 2 to   	    Python version 3 is not backwardly compatible with Python 2.

Library                         Many recent developers are creating          Many older libraries created for Python 2 is not forward-compatible.
                                libraries which you can only use with
                                Python 3.
