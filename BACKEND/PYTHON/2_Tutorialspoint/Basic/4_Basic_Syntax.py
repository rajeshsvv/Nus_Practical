# Python Identifiers:
# Starting an identifier with a single leading underscore indicates that the identifier is private.

# Starting an identifier with two leading underscores indicates a strongly private identifier.

# If the identifier also ends with two trailing underscores, the identifier is a 
# language-defined special name.

# -c cmd : program passed in as string (terminates option list)
# -d     : debug output from parser (also PYTHONDEBUG=x)
# -E     : ignore environment variables (such as PYTHONPATH)
# -h     : print this help message and exit
