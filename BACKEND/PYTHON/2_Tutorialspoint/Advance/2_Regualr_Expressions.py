"""
A regular expression is a special sequence of characters that helps you match or find other strings or sets of strings,
using a specialized syntax held in a pattern



                                            1.The match Function

This function attempts to match RE pattern to string with optional flags.
re.match(pattern, string, flags=0)


pattern:
This is the regular expression to be matched.

string:
This is the string, which would be searched to match the pattern at the beginning of string.

flags:
You can specify different flags using bitwise OR (|). These are modifiers.


The re.match function returns a match object on success, None on failure.
We usegroup(num) or groups() function of match object to get matched expression.


group(num=0):

This method returns entire match (or specific subgroup num).


groups():

This method returns all matching subgroups in a tuple (empty if there weren't any).



                                    2.The search Function

This function searches for first occurrence of RE pattern within string with optional flags.
Here is the syntax for this function âˆ’
re.search(pattern, string, flags=0)

same as above.



Matching Versus Searching
Python offers two different primitive operations based on regular expressions:
match checks for a match only at the beginning of the string, while
search checks for a match anywhere in the string (this is what Perl does by default).


Search and Replace
One of the most important re methods that use regular expressions is sub.

Syntax
re.sub(pattern, repl, string, max=0)

This method replaces all occurrences of the RE pattern in string with repl,
substituting all occurrences unless max provided. This method returns modified string.

# example for match fucntion this is same as for search function also:
"""

# Regular Expression Patterns

# Except for control characters, (+ ? . * ^ $ ( ) [ ] { } | \), all characters match themselves.
# You can escape a control character by preceding it with a backslash.


"""
^           Matches beginning of line.

            If in parentheses, only that area is affected.


(?-imx)     Temporarily toggles off i, m, or x options within a regular expression.
            If in parentheses, only that area is affected.

(?: re)     Groups regular expressions without remembering matched text.

(?imx: re)  Temporarily toggles on i, m, or x options within parentheses.

(?-imx: re) Temporarily togglesoff i, m, or x options within parentheses.

(?#...)     Comment.
